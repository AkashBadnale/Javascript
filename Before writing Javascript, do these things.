Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/, because we need this to run .js files. And Install the downloaded file.

Then you will need an IDE to run js files, i'm using Atom, SO download and install it.
After installing Atom go to 
File  -->  Setting  -->   Install  -->  search for `Script` package  --> Install it  -->  Close the IDE & restart it.

Then run your javascript file by going to
Packages  -->  Script  -->  Run Script  
OR
ctrl + shift  +  B
